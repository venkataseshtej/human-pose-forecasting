# Human Pose Forecasting with Transformers

This project predicts future human body poses using a Transformer model and VPoser latent space encoding.  
It is based on the AMASS dataset and SMPL body model.

## Project Structure

- `hyperparameter_tuning.py` — Main script for model training and hyperparameter optimization (Optuna)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `run_tuning.sh` — Bash script for reproducible training
- `dataset/` — (Ignored) Data files for training/validation/testing
- `VPoserModelFiles/` — (Ignored) Pretrained VPoser model files
- `tuning_results/` — (Ignored) Output models, logs, and plots
